# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## My Task

To create a simple multiple-choice quiz with questions related to JavaScript fundamentals, equipped with a countdown timer and highscore register. This assignment will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to present an app with sharp visuals and clean functionality. The code will be concise and adaptable so that if there be a future desire to broaden the scope of subjects and questions, it could easily be updated.

## User Story

The allotted time given for the quiz is 30 seconds and is displayed in the top right corner of the screen. The quiz consists of 5 questions. Each question has 4 choices which populate in random order. After an answer is submitted the user will be alerted whether it is correct. For each question answered correctly the user is awarded 2 points. The user is penalized 1 point for each wrong answer. If the user answers all questions correctly, any remaining time is added to their score. The lowest possible score a user can receive is zero. Once the quiz is completed either by all questions being answered or the countdown timer expiring the user will be asked to enter their initials with a minimum of 3 characters. If the user's score ranks in the top 3 it will be recorded and displayed in the top left corner of the screen.
